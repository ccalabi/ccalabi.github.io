<div id="Hogwarts" style="display:none;">
	<p>Welcome to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft, Wizardry, and the Force! It's the start of a new year, and everyone is in the 
	Great Hall waiting for the start-of-term feast to begin.  You're greeting your old friends and saying hello to new first year 
	students.  You see a new student sitting on their own, separated by a couple of spaces on either side.  He seems to be a bit 
	of an odd character, different from the other students.  Hogwarts has begun accepting and training young Jedis!  In the days 
	following the welcome feast, how do you treat this unusual first year?</p>
</div>

<div id="Endor" style="display:none;">
	<p>You are now in Endor, a small forested moon located in the Outer Rim Territories and also the homeland of Ewoks, 
	a type of species. It's known to be quite dangerous here, but don't worry, you should be fine! You will be staying at 
	its major city, Bright Tree Village. Endure is affiliated with the Galactic Empire, so expect to see a bunch of Stormtroopers 
	hovering around. Since this is a major homeland to Ewoks, you will be surrounded by them. Let's just say they are an  
	interesting little species. They are very skilled in forest survival and use spears, slings, and knives as weapons. Even 
	though they are fairly small, Ewoks are physically strong enough to overpower combat-trained humans.</p>
</div>

<div id="DiagonAlley" style="display:none;">
	<p>You just passed through the magical brick wall in the Leaky Cauldron into Diagon Alley!  You are an assistant/salesperson 
	in Floursih & Blotts, the largest magical bookshop in London.  You see all the Hogwarts students come in with their parents 
	and friends to get their books for the next year, and you see all the witches and wizards who come in for all their literary 
	needs.  <br/>One day a few weeks before the start-of-the-school-year rush, the manager of Flourish & Blotts calls a meeting and 
	introduces the newest salesperson, an odd-looking, slightly bizarre youngster.  The gossip is that the new Hogwarts graduate 
	was the only person the shop manager could find to take the position.  </p>
</div>

<div id="Coruscant" style="display:none;">
	<p>Welcome to Coruscant! Coruscant is located in the Inner Core and basically is the most influential planet in the entire 
	galaxy. There are a couple affiliations with Coruscant, a very important one is the New Republic. You will be transported to 
	Galactic City, a major city in Coruscant. This is a very diverse city, home to many different species and creatures. Once you 
	are out in the big city, a strange creature approaches you. This creature has two heads and eight eyes.</p>

<!--Failure Descriptions-->
<div id="failHogwarts" style="display:none;">
	<p>Time has flown and it's Christmastime already!  Exams are finished and you're home with your family for the holidays.  
	Friends from school come to visit on many days, or you go to see them.  No one is thinking about exams, except the book-crazy 
	Hermione Granger, and that odd young padawan (Jedi-in-training), who seems determined to prove himself.  An owl arrives a few 
	days before the holiday ends, carrying your grades.  You find the letter on the kitchen table and immediately tear it open.  
	You felt like you aced two of your classes, and you're sure you passed the other three.<br/><br/>
	You pull out the slip of paper, find the list of your classes, and skim to the letters next to it: One E (exceeds 
	expectations), two A's (acceptable, lowest passing grade), one P (poor, must repeat subject),and one D (dreadful, must repeat 
	subject).</p>
</div>

<div id="failEndor" style="display:none;">
	<p>You are an Ewok and you are a part of a large group of other Ewoks. They have just asked you to be on the look-out for 
	Stormtroopers. Your mission is to prevent the Stormtroopers from invading your group's territory. Unfortunately you get 
	distracted and fail your task. The Stormtroopers invade and do massive destruction to the territory. You disappointed your 
	group.</p>
</div>
	
<div id="failDiagonAlley" style="display:none;">
	<p>You've enjoyed your time as a clerk at Flourish & Blotts, but it's time to move on and start a career.  As one of the 
	first Jedi students to graduate from Hogwarts, with good grades too, you expect that employers will jump at the chance to 
	hire you.  You've applied at the Ministry of Magic to be Assistant to the Junior Head of Muggle Artifacts, at Weasleys' 
	Wizard Wheezes to be a product tester and sourcer, and at St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries to be a 
	healer of spell damage.<br/> <br/>
	It's been three weeks, and you haven't heard a peep from any of these potential employers.  A few more days pass, 
	and then you get the first owl post reply: "Thank you for your application to become a product tester and sourcer at 
	Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes.  However, we are unable to offer you a position at this time."  Later that day, another owl arrives, 
	bearing a similar reply:  St. Mungo's Hospital has rejected you as well.  The next morning you check to see if any owls 
	arrived, and find a letter on the kitchen table.  You break the Ministry of Magic seal on the back and pull out the paper 
	inside.  Your eyes quickly search the page. The words "unable to offer you a position" jump out as if they're in bold type.  
	Once again, rejected. </p>
</div>	

<div id="failCoruscant" style="display:none;">
	<p>You are a young padawan. As a Jedi Apprentice, your Jedi Master has given you important instructions on the the following 
	task: Obtain the lightsaber using the Force. As you stand still and focus, you can see the lightsaber slowly hovering above 
	the ground, but you always lose focus whenever you try to retrieve it. Your Jedi Master is disappointed about the lack of 
	your progress.</p>
</div>


<!--STORIES-->

<!--Hogwarts-->
<div id="HogwartsStory" style="display:none;">
	<p>It's the Battle of Hogwarts.  The castle is on fire and crumbling beneath the Death Eaters' onslaught.  Students, members 
	of the Order of the Phoenix, Death Eaters, residents of Hogsmeade, house elves, giants, and many others are furiously 
	battling in the castle, on the grounds, and in the skies.  The situation seems hopeless, Voldemort's ranks are too numerous, 
	they simply overwhelm the Hogwarts defenses and keep on swarming in.  You see bodies littering the ground, human and creature 
	alike, from both sides of the battle.  You are returning from setting up traps in some upstairs corridors for the Death 
	Eaters to ensnare themselves in.  As you descend the stairs into the Entrance Hall, the fighting thickens.  Spells are flying 
	everywhere, ricocheting off the walls, blasting the stone apart.  A haze of dust and smoke fills the air.  There are numerous 
	pairs and groups locked in battle, you see Professor McGonagall sending curse after curse at two masked Death Eaters, and one 
	of the new Jedi students is doing his best to manipulate the Death Eaters' minds to confuse them and slow them down.  A few 
	enemies notice you as you come down the stairs, and curses begin flying in your direction.  You quickly produce a shield 
	charm to deflect them.</p>
</div>

<div id="HogwartsFirebolt" style="display:none;">
	<p>You suddenly see a Firebolt broomstick lying partially hidden in some rubble.  What do you do with it?  <br/><br/>
	You cannot apparate yet, so you climb on the broom and fly away from the castle, it's much too dangerous to be there! <br/><br/>
	You grab it, run out of the Entrance Hall, and fly up to circle one of the giants who are destroying the castle.  
	You want to take down as many giants as possible from this high vantage point where your spells can reach their faces, their 
	one weak spot.  You know that you won't survive long in the air, what with spells going everywhere and the giants flailing 
	arms and clubs, but stopping the giants would help everyone.  You manage to fell two of the four giants before you are 
	swatted from the sky, and from life, by a giant's club. <br/><br/> 
	You see the young Jedi fall to the floor, hit by a stunning spell and now defenseless.  You take the 
	broomstick, run down to the Jedi, pick him up and pull him onto the broom with you.  You fly him to safety within the 
	castle where Madam Pomfrey is healing other wounded and spell-damaged fighters. Then you return to pick up other fallen and 
	injured fighters, dodging curses and giants and werewolves as you fly. <br/><br/> 
	You jump onto the Firebolt, and fly high above to see how the battle is progressing.  When you do, you see a swarm of 
	dementors approaching the castle.  You fly towards them, and meet them just as they are nearing the entrance to the castle.  
	You think of the happiest memory you have and cast a patronus charm so powerful that it drives every dementor far away, and 
	keeps them there.  You will gain great fame for your achievement tonight.</p>
</div>

<div id="HogwartsLightsaber" style="display:none;">
	<p>The young Jedi student fighting below is hit by a curse that kills him.  You reach his side just in time for him to give 
	you his light saber.  What do you do with it? <br/><br/>
	You use it to deflect the curses flying around and to cut down any enemies in your way as you run out of Hogwarts and down 
	towards the village of Hogsmeade, where you will be safe.  It's too dangerous to stay here!<br/><br/>
	You go search for one of the other Jedi students, knowing that they can wield the lightsaber much better than you can.  You r
	un up into the towers of the castle where there are many fighters, and you spot a young Jedi dodging curses down a corridor.  
	You sprint to her and quickly hand over the light saber.  She had lost her own during the battle and so had little defense 
	against the onslaught of spells.  You see many curses coming right at the two of you, and you know that you only have the 
	power to stop some of them.  You perform a shield charm and throw yourself in front of the startled Jedi, catching the other 
	curses with your body.  One of them is the killing curse, and you fall to the ground, never to rise again.<br/><br/>
	You see Professor McGonagall get hit with a curse that tightly binds her in ropes.  She drops her wand and falls to the ground.  
	You run to her side and use the lightsaber to cut the ropes that have completely wrapped around her body while you produce a 
	shield charm with your wand to protect both of you.<br/><br/>
	You use it to kill Voldemort's snake, Nagini, that Voldemort made into a horcrux (an object containing part of his soul so he 
	can't die).  The only way to kill Voldemort is to get rid of all the horcruxes first.  Now that Nagini is out of the way, you 
	go search for Voldemort himself.  If you kill him, you will go down in history as the bravest and most powerful wizard...</p>
</div>

<div id="HogwartsATAT" style="display:none;">
	<p>You remember that the young Jedi student fighting below has a small scale model of a giant machine called an AT-AT up in 
	his room.  You call to him and ask him if he still has the model.  He does have it, up in his dormitory somewhere.  You 
	perform a summoning charm and the model comes zooming down to you.  You leave the castle and walk onto the grounds.  You 
	perform an engorgement charm on the model, enlarging it until it is as big as the giants Voldemort brought with him.  Then 
	you climb up into the pilot's cockpit.  Now what do you do with the AT-AT? <br/> <br/>
	You turn the machine around and stomp your way out of the Hogwarts grounds, it's much too dangerous to stay! <br/> <br/>
	You turn to the giants and start to fight them, knowing that eventually they will knock you down, but they are causing 
	much of the wreckage to the castle and they're crushing many fighters beneath their feet.  You take down three of the four 
	giants, but the last one places a well-aimed blow with his huge club and you and the pilot's cockpit are crushed. <br/> <br/>
	You see Grawp, Hagrid's giant half-brother, getting beaten up by two of Voldemort's giants.  You direct the AT-AT over to the 
	giants and start shooting them with the guns mounted on the AT-AT.  This distracts and wounds them, allowing Grawp to pick 
	himself up and finish them off. <br/> <br/>
	You see another big group of Voldemort's supporters gathering to the side of the castle, preparing to launch a new 
	attack from that angle.  No one else has seen the new group yet, but you don't sound the alarm, you maneuver the AT-AT towards 
	them and begin firing the guns attached to the machine.  The group, comprised of mostly wizards, quickly puts up a shield 
	around themselves, but a shield charm can't block an AT-AT.   
	Their spells bounce off the machine, and you soon reach the group and crush them.  That threat is finished!  You turn the 
	AT-AT back to the castle to continue fighting, you know you will be praised and awarded for your actions tonight!</p>
</div>

<div id="HogwartsInvisibility" style="display:none;">
	<p>Suddenly, Harry Potter runs by you, and sprints out of the Entrance Hall onto the grounds.  You stand in awe for a couple 
	of seconds, and then notice that he dropped a bundle of cloth at the bottom of the stairs.  You pick it up and discover that 
	it's a cloak!  You hold the cloak up to look at it and then drape it over your arm.  It becomes invisible!  You 
	realize that this is an invisibility cloak and quickly pull it on.  While you are distracted by the cloak, another of Voldemort's 
	minions comes into the Entrance Hall and spots you.  You've just pulled the cloak on when he fires a curse at you.  You 
	look up and see it coming, but it's too late to stop it.  But the curse doesn't hit you!  The cloak turns the curse 
	aside!  What do you do with the cloak? <br/><br/>
	You run out of the castle and through the grounds, slipping unseen and untouched through the fighting.  You run down to the 
	village of Hogsmeade, from where you can disapparate and get out of there! It's too dangerous to stay! <br/><br/>
	You look out into the grounds and see Neville Longbottom dueling Bellatrix Lestrange.  Neville is tiring, and looks like he 
	might fall at any moment.  You run over to him, push him out of Bellatrix's line of fire, and perform a shield charm.  You 
	pull off the cloak, hand it to Neville, and push him back toward the castle.  He hesitates, but grabs the cloak and runs.  
	You turn back to face Bellatrix, knowing you are no match for her, just as her curse shatters your shield.  You send a curse 
	back to her, which she easily blocks.  Her next curse, which comes only a second after the first, gets in under your defenses, 
	and you fall to the ground, dead.<br/><br/>
	You look out into the grounds and see one of the other young Jedi being chased by a giant spider.  The Jedi  student is 
	terrified, and is in danger not only of being eaten by the spider, but of being hit by one of the spells flying around him.  
	You run out into the fray, sprinting toward the Jedi and spider.  Finally you catch up to them, the Jedi is cornered, he has 
	no place to go but into the spider's pincers.  You swirl the cloak to cover him too.  The two of you barely fit under the 
	cloak, but you hold onto him and run back toward the castle, leaving a very confused spider behind. <br/><br/>
	You decide that, since the cloak gives you almost perfect protection, you are going to attack the strongest Death Eaters when 
	they aren't expecting it.  You first see Rodolphus Lestrange fighting Mrs. Weasley, and as you move by them, you stun 
	Lestrange from behind.  Then you take out Knott, Avery, and two more masked Death Eaters, hiding beneath the cloak and 
	stunning them.  They never see you coming.  You know that you'll be praised and held in awe for your achievements.

<!--Endor-->
<div id="EndorStory" style="display:none;">
	<p>You and your friend just apparated onto Endor. You both quietly and carefully roam through the forest trying not to alert 
	any possible traps. As wizards, it’s important not to get caught by Stormtroopers or just the Galactic Empire in general or 
	else you will be turned into Darth Vader and experience dark consequences. As you and your friend hide behind a tree, you 
	both see large groups of Ewoks furiously gathering their weapons and creating a perimeter around the forest. It’s unclear 
	what exactly is happening, so you cautiously glance beyond your surroundings and observe that there are two Tie Fighters 
	flying above the forest blasting at targets. You must do something! It’s not safe to hide behind that tree during this 
	unexpected battle.</p>
</div>

<div id="EndorFirebolt" style="display:none;">
	<p>At this very specific moment, what would you do?<br/><br/>
	Get on your Firebolt Broomstick and fly the heck outta there!<br/><br/>
	Only two Tie Fighters? You got this! You get on your Firebolt Broomstick and you fly up towards the Tie Fighters casting spells on them.<br/><br/>
	You feel very bad for getting your friend into a situation like this, so you give them your Firebolt Broomstick and help them fly out of danger.<br/><br/>
	You can be brave and fly yourself to Darth Vader and turn yourself in and face the dark consequences.</p>
</div>

<div id="EndorLightsaber" style="display:none;">
	<p>At this very specific moment, what would you do?<br/><br/>
	How’s a single lightsaber going to bring down two Tie Fighters? Take a run for it! (Sorry friend, good luck)<br/><br/>
	You are a wizard, you are capable of anything! You are going to light up your lightsaber and fight like there’s no tomorrow.<br/><br/>
	Your friend doesn’t have a lightsaber, they seem to be very scared, so you help them out and give them your lightsaber.<br/><br/>
	You want your friend to be able to apperate back to Hogwarts, so you wave your lightsaber at them to distract them while your friend escapes the scene.</p>
</div>

<div id="EndorATAT" style="display:none;">
	<p>At this very specific moment, what would you do?<br/><br/>
	Because of the danger, you may choose to get in your AT-AT as a pilot and run away, leaving your friend behind.<br/><br/>
	Maybe you are feeling courageous and you will take on the fight and battle against the Tie Fighters with your AT-AT.<br/><br/>
	You’ll help your friend out because you care about them and their safety, so you give them your AT-AT.<br/><br/>
	The only way to bring down those Tie Fighters is to detonate the AT-AT, creating a massive explosion, but you must be inside 
	the AT-AT in order to initiate the detonation.</p>
</div>

<div id="EndorInvisibility" style="display:none;">
	<p>At this very specific moment, what would you do?<br/><br/>
	You are extremely terrified, so you put on your cloak and quickly run away leaving your friend behind.<br/><br/>
	You’ll put on your cloak and face this battle, plus they won’t be able to see you so that’s a plus, right?<br/><br/>
	You look back and see your friend having a panic attack, so you decide to tell them to put your cloak on to help them calm 
	down.<br/><br/>
	You’re a wizard, so you also carry a wand. You decide to put the cloak on and cast the strongest spell you have towards the 
	Tie Fighters causing you to get extremely hurt to the point where you might not live, but you will have successfully beat the 
	Tie Fighters.</p>
</div>


<!--Diagon Alley-->
<div id="DiagonAlleyStory" style="display:none;">
	<p>You have become a top-security vault guard and dragon trainer at Gringotts Wizarding Bank!  You are going about your duties 
	one day when the alarm is sounded that there are intruders, thieves!, in Gringotts!  You hurry to the dragon's side, you have 
	become good friends with him as you've been working with him, thanks to your Jedi training and abilities.  Out of the corner 
	of your eye, you notice three people lurking in a corridor leading to some of the top-security vaults.  You see a glint of 
	gold, and know that they must have already gotten into a vault.  Suddenly a horde of the goblins who run Gringotts come 
	flooding into the dragon's chamber, yelling "Thieves!" and brandishing their weapons.  You know that they will want to make 
	the dragon fight the thieves, and that the dragon, who was mistreated and even tortured by the goblins before they hired you, 
	only wants to be free from his underground dungeon.  The three thieves unexpectedly jump onto the dragon's back, apparently thinking 
	to fly to his and their freedom in the sky hundreds of feet above.  Will you help the dragon, and the thieves, escape or will 
	you do the job you were hired for and help the goblins stop the thieves and keep the dragon imprisoned?</p>
</div>

<div id="DiagonAlleyFirebolt" style="display:none;">
	<p>Using your Jedi powers, you bring your Firebolt broomstick that is in a nearby corridor to you.  What do you do with the 
	Firebolt?<br/><br/>
	You jump on the broom and fly away, up through the corridors and out of the bank.  They can figure that situation out for 
	themselves!<br/><br/>
	You hop on your broom, fly up to face all the goblins and use your Jedi mind powers to make them stand still and silent.  You 
	let the thieves and dragon go free, but at the price of your job.<br/><br/>
	You get on the broom and fly up to the top of the cavern so that it looks like you are blocking the exit.  But with your Jedi 
	mind powers you talk to the dragon and tell him what is going on and what he needs to do to be free.  The dragon escapes, and 
	you work together to make it look like you tried to stop the dragon and thieves.<br/><br/>
	You get on the broom and fly above the dragon so you can use your Jedi mind powers on the thieves to make them get off the 
	dragon and turn themselves in.  You know you'll get a pay raise and probably a promotion for this!
	</p>
</div>

<div id="DiagonAlleyLightsaber" style="display:none;">
	<p>You pull out the lightsaber that you always carry with you.  What do you do with it?<br/><br/>
	You use the lightsaber to fight your way through the throng of angry goblins, and then you run up the corridors and out of 
	Gringotts.  They can stop the thieves themselves!<br/><br/>
	You jump in front of the dragon and the thieves and yell to the goblins that if they want to stop the thieves they'll have to 
	get through you!  You know that you'll lose your job, but you'll have helped your dragon friend be free!<br/><br/>
	You jump in front of the horde of goblins and seem to join their group, but with your Jedi mind powers you tell the dragon 
	what to do to escape.  You even surreptitiously cut the dragon's chains with the lightsaber.<br/><br/>

	a promotion!</p>

	<p>You remember your Jedi mind powers while you're watching the scene in front of you.  What do you do with them?<br/><br/>

	it looks like you are helping them, but in reality you help the dragon, and the thieves, go free.<br/><br/>
	You force the dragon to remain in place and force the thieves to get down and turn themselves in. You know you'll get a pay 
	raise and probably a promotion for this!

</div>


<!--Coruscant-->
<div id="CoruscantStory" style="display:none;">
	<p>Young Wizard Padawan, your duty is needed. Coruscant has been invaded by the Stormtroopers. Darth Vader has sent them as 
	an order to attain you. At this very moment, you’ve got to escape the building you are currently in and find your Jedi Master 
	for a battle like this. You must travel across Galactic City, Stormtroopers are currently working on creating a perimeter 
	around you so that they can trap you. By using the Force, your Jedi Master sent you a secret message telling you to meet 
	him/her at the top of the highest building in the city. As you take a quick turn, a large group of Stormtroopers march towards 
	you causing you to turn around and take a different route. As soon as you reach the rooftop, you accidentally trip while the 
	Stormtroopers quickly catch up to you.</p>
</div>

<div id="CoruscantFirebolt" style="display:none;">
	<p>At this very specific moment, what would you do?<br/><br/>
	You summon your Firebolt broomstick, rapidly making its way to you, you hop on it and vanish you way off of the buildings 
	rooftop.<br/><br/>
	Once you summon your broomstick from your room, you get on it and you start manipulating the Stormtroopers into thinking that 
	you are at the bottom of the building. Once they leave, you make your way to your Jedi Master and you start to cast spells on 
	all the Stormtroopers that are trying to defeat him.<br/><br/>
	As you lay on the ground, you think about your Jedi Master and how much he is struggling, so you manipulate the Stormtroopers 
	around you and you use the Force to send your broomstick to your Jedi Master so that he can fly his way out of the mess he is 
	in.<br/><br/>
	You care a lot about your Jedi Master and you also believe in sacrificing yourself in order to resolve this battle. You 
	are not afraid of Darth Vader, so you surrender yourself to the Stormtroopers and you allow them to attain you. You’ll be 
	visiting Darth Vader very soon, and it will not be pretty.</p>
</div>

<div id="CoruscantLightsaber" style="display:none;">
	<p>At this very specific moment, what would you do?<br/><br/>
	You take out your lightsaber and blade through all the Stormtroopers around you and runaway from the building.<br/><br/>
	You want to make your Jedi Master proud of you, so you defeat all the Stormtroopers with your lightsaber.<br/><br/>
	Your Jedi Master is is struggling, so you use the Force to hand him your lightsaber so that he can attack twice as more 
	Stormtroopers.<br/><br/>
	You see no way out, you are completely surrounded by them so you decide to surrender yourself to them. </p>
</div>

<div id="CoruscantATAT" style="display:none;">
	<p>At this very specific moment, what would you do?<br/><br/>
	You get on the AT-AT you attained and hide in there while you run away, leaving your Jedi Master behind.<br/><br/>
	Stormtroopers have terrible aim anyways, you decide to get in your AT-AT (by casting a spell) and you start blasting out all 
	the Stromtroopers coming your way.<br/><br/>
	Your Jedi Master needs help, you can see him struggling as he take on dozens of Stormtroopers, so you cast a spell that puts 
	your Master in the AT-AT.<br/><br/>
	You let the Stormtroopers catch you or else your Master will have more of them to fight and he is already struggling alone.</p>
</div>

<div id="CoruscantInvisibility" style="display:none;">
	<p>At this very specific moment, what would you do?<br/><br/>
	With your cloak of invisibility, you quickly put it over you as you become invisible, and run away from the Stormtroopers.<br/><br/>
	You put on your cloak of invisibility and confuse the Stormtroopers as to where you are, and you start casting spells on them 
	as you make your way to your Jedi Master.<br/><br/>
	As you glance at your Jedi Master, you can notice that he could use some great help, so you use the Force and you hand your 
	Master the cloak so he can put it over him, that way he will become invisible to the Stormtroopers that were trying to blast 
	him.<br/><br/>
	You want to sacrifice your life for your Jedi Master, but you don’t want him to see you get hurt and blasted by the 
	Stormtroopers. You decide to put on your cloak as you lay on the ground waiting for all the Stormtroopers to start blasting 
	in all directions. You close your eyes and wait for the moment to come.</p>

			<h2 id="section4">Project Description</h2>
			<p>Take this quiz to find out who you are in the PotterWars world! Your personality will be described by a lightsaber 
			wood and color.  Basically, lightsabers are now being made with certain woods that match to the user based on 
			specific personality characteristics.</p>
			<p>The highest score is the personality you are most like</p>
			<p>Enjoy!</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="design">
			<h2 id="section1">Design Considerations</h2>
			<p>We made the design and challenges section a dropdown section so that it wouldn't interfere with the look of the quiz.
			We made the background a mysterious fog that works for both Star Wars and Harry Potter.</p>
			<p>Also, when the personality is revealed, we decided to have it show all the personalities and how much of each you 
			are.  We felt this provides more info about Harry Potter and Star Wars and the personality that you are.</p>

		<div class="challenges">
			<h2 id="section2">Challenges</h2>
			<p>Our first challenge was getting all the buttons and questions to show and hide when they should.  Once that part 
			was finished, with the quiz progressing as it should, we encountered problems with how to determine the personality. 
			 With Wes' help, we decided to have each answer add or subtract points to each personality, and the personaliity with 
			 the highest points at the end was the one you are.</p>
			 <p>We would have liked to add pictures and more cool stuff to the questions, but we ran out of time.</p>

			<h2 id="section3">Technology & Acknowledgements</h2>
			<p>In our Javascript we used arrays, if-else statements, and the .html and .append DOM manipulations. 
			We used code from Stackoverflow user Amber to calculate the user's personality (the code is noted in the Javascript).  
			Wes gave us the idea of calculating the personality in this way.
