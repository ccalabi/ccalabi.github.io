			<p> When I'm not in class, I enjoy reading, especially fantasy, historical fiction, and some science fiction; doing needlework, which is kind of a grandma-like thing to do, but I greatly like it; bicycling, especially in my small home town where there aren't as many cars as in Santa Cruz; and contra dancing, which is a little-known type of line dancing.</p>
		
			<p>An unusual fact about me is that I am obsessed with avocados and guacamole!</p>
		
			<p>In this class, I am excited to learn some programming and web design, since I have very little experience with either one.</p>
