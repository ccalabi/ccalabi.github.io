					<h2>About Me</h2>
					<p>Hello!  Thanks for viewing my portfolio.  I'm Cori, a relatively recent graduate from UC Santa Cruz with degrees in Human Biology and Computer Science.  My ideal career would be something that combines my love of tech with my interest in medicine.</p>
					<p>I've built a web app and iOS app, programmed in JavaScript, Java, C, and Assembly, with a little Python on the side, and have greatly enjoyed it all.  I love a challenge, and I think that one of the best feelings is that breakthrough when you finally find a bug in your program and get it to work right.</p>
					<p>I'm looking for work in web development (mainly front end), testing, or automation.  However, learning and variety are two of my favorite things, so I'm very open to expanding my skillset for positions in another area.</p>
					<h2>Projects</h2>

					<b><a href="tipsyWeb/index.html">Tipsy Trials</a></b> sobriety testing web app created with four peers. It was created over the course of about eight weeks and was the first experience with web apps for all of us.
				
					<p><b><a href="http://www.sunwork.org/Installation_map.html" target="_blank">SunWork installation map</a></b> I created for the business using JavaScript and Google Maps APIs (initially using Google Fusion Tables before Google retired this feature).</p>

					<h4>Intro to Computer Graphics:</h4>
					<ul id="graphics">
						<li><a href="graphics/picking/picking.html">Picking</a></li>
						<li><a href="graphics/cameraControls.html">Camera Controls</a></li>
						<li><a href="graphics/textures/textures.html">Textures</a></li>
					</ul>

					<p><b><a href="programmingArts/index.html">PotterWars</a>:</b>  Programming for the Arts was the first programming class I took, and it sparked my interest to pursue a computer science double major.  For the final project in this class, my friend and I created a sort of personality test that combined my love of Harry Potter with her love of Star Wars.  (Note: This has not been updated since it was completed)</p>
